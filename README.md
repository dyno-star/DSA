# 📚 DSA Using Python - Self Learning

## Overview

This repository contains my self-learning journey through **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Python**. It is organized by topic and includes implementations, explanations, and example problems. The goal is to deepen my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts while preparing for technical interviews and problem-solving.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Hash Tables and Sets
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Heaps and Priority Queues

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-using-python.git
   cd dsa-using-python
   ```

2. Run any script with Python:
   ```
   python path/to/your_script.py
   ```

3. (Optional) Open `.ipynb` notebooks using Jupyter for step-by-step code walkthroughs.

> Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

## 🧪 Testing

Some implementations may include test cases using `unittest` or simple assertions.  
To run tests:
```
python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
```

## 📈 Progress

This project is ongoing and updated regularly as I explore more problems and patterns.
